A quick note for Python 3 users for the Map, Reduce, and
Filter functions. These functions return iterators in Python 3 
instead of lists (as in Python 2). To get a list for any of
these functions in Python 3, you can just cast it as a list 
using list() around the function.
Also in Python 3, reduce is imported from functools.
